* Gio's Tetris 
This is my attempt to create a tetris game with
pygame. Honestly I know there are infinite other
attempts out there mostly success and so much
better examples but I still want to try it out, to
learn more how to use 

1. def
2. class

this things that makes efficient a program and
object oriented stuff. Even though I am not sure
if that makes sense or not. 
Anyways
Let's try it out!

State of the art of now: 

I manage to have some sort of solidifying thing,
but sometimes it doesnt really work, but most
times it does!

Good Luck

* Omg 
it looks so nice it's basically perfect, but there
are some stuff which don't work super well. Like,
when you go inside something from lateral and not
from the top, well you shouldn't be able to do
that.

* Also One thing

Add new shapes, with like class

* Also

As soon as you delete lines, the game should go
faster, and you can do it with levels and the
counter variable which I already created
