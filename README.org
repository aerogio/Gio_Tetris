* Gio's Tetris 
This is my attempt to create a tetris game with
pygame. Honestly I know there are infinite other
attempts out there mostly success and so much
better examples but I still want to try it out, to
learn more how to use 
- def
- class

this things that makes efficient a program

** v1 

Basically I need to 
- create new shape
- create solidity in the bottom
- Manage to delete the line when it's full
