* Gio's Tetris 
This is my attempt to create a tetris game with
pygame. Honestly I know there are infinite other
attempts out there mostly success and so much

Basically I need to 
- create new shape
- create solidity in the bottom
- Manage to delete the line when it's full

** v2
I created v2 because I was unsure, but luckily it

v2 in v1, let's see
