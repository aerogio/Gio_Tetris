* Gio's Tetris 
This is my attempt to create a tetris game with
pygame. Honestly I know there are infinite other
attempts out there mostly success and so much
better examples but I still want to try it out, to
learn more how to use 

- def
- class

this things that makes efficient a program and
object oriented stuff. Even though I am not sure
if that makes sense or not. 
Anyways
Let's try it out!

State of the art of now: 

I manage to have some sort of solidifying thing,
but sometimes it doesnt really work, but most
times it does!

NEXT UP: try to kill the ring when it's full.

Good Luck
